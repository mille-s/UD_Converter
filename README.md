# UD_Converter

This converter takes as input a *.conllu file with UD annotations and produces a predicate-argument structure. It can be used to create training material (e.g. for natural language generation tools) or to extract semantics-oriented relations from UD trees. For now, documentation can be found on the SRST website:  http://taln.upf.edu/pages/msr2020-ws/SRST.html.
